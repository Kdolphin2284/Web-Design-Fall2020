        Amazon video is a popular subscription service that consists of popular movies and shows, as 
        well as “amazon original” shows and movies. 
    </p>

        I chose to redesign amazon video because of the cluttered homepage. The homepage consists of 
        lists of movies and shows, as well as plenty of drop down menus. The whole idea of having the homepage 
        be a list of movies, rather than an organized space that allows the user to get to where they want to 
        go easily and with little thought boggled me. Getting into the redesign, the first step was to see what 
        ideas should stay, and how should they be organized. To figure this out, I did a “card sorting” exercise 
        with people I found around my campus.

    <p>
        This “card sorting” exercise consisted of note cards which had one clickable option from amazon video 
        written on each card. I had 4 different people organize these cards into categories that they thought 
        made sense. Once they had organized the cards, I asked them questions such as “Why did you place this 
        card here?” or “Do you think that these could be organized differently?” to understand their thought 
        processes. After this, I created a site map for how the navigation on the redesign should be by averaging 
        their organization choices.

        Once I had created a site map, the next step was to take this information and form wireframes to get a 
        loose layout of how the redesign should look.

    <p>
        Once I created these wireframes of the two pages I was redesigning, I sought feedback from my professor, 
        who said how everything shouldn’t be as “boxy” as it is at the moment. He also made a suggestion about 
        the navigation bar and how I should keep that at the top rather than splitting it up into 3 sections as 
        shown above. With this insight into design, I turned my wireframes into actual website designs with color 
        and text.

    <p>
        My final designs consisted of three pages, instead of the original two that I was planning to make. 
        The first 2 pages show the homepage, with the second page showing how the dropdown menus looked. The 
        third page shows the movies page, while the fourth page shows the popular movies page. Instead of making 
        the layout consist of rows of boxes, I only had 3 clickable options except for the navigation menus, 
        which may have been boxes, but I spaced them out to give it a more open feel. 
    </p>

        I ended up taking the advice that my professor gave me and had the navigation bar stay as an actual bar 
        that was universal and simplified the drop-down menus to only two. I had the options in the menus be 
        different colors to add variation in what the viewer sees. Lastly, I added an option to click on one of 
        the “daily deals” on the homepage and by doing this a pop-up would appear with the description of the movie, 
        as well as the price to buy and rent it.
