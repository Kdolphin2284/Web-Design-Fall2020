        Allied News is a news platform catering to the Grove City, Lakeview, Mercer, and Slippery Rock areas. 
        The site posts updates to local and national events, as well as talking about different issues in the 
        world.

        I chose to redesign the Allied News website because of how cluttered the home page was. The page had 
        popular news stories at the top, and national news and other stories underneath. While this sounds like 
        an ordinary news page, there were constant huge spaces between stories and categories which held advertisements 
        on advertisements. Having a lot of ads on a page is not necessarily a bad thing, but if they aren’t organized 
        sufficiently, then it makes the website look ugly. My original plan was to reorganize the ads, get rid of 
        random spacings between articles and sections, and make the site look more “modern”.

        These are screenshots of the original home page of Allied News, as well as an article page on the computer. 
        The tablet version looks identical, just slightly smaller, while the smartphone is very messy. The layout 
        is incredibly crammed, and while it doesn’t have huge spaces between the different sections, it needs to be 
        renovated. I started my redesign process off by creating wireframes of how the layout of the site could look.

    <p>
        These are the original wireframes that I created for my redesign. I got rid of all of the awkward spacing 
        in between each article and brought everything closer together. One thing that I did do was delete most of 
        the ads and have one area where the ads would circulate through, kind of like a carousal. I sought insight 
        for my design from my professor, who then told me that I wasn’t allowed to compress or delete ads, so in my 
        final design I decided to space out the ads accordingly, while still keeping the spacing between articles 
        close.

        These are my final designs for the computer, tablet, and mobile platforms. I added the advertisements 
        back into the redesign, while keeping everything spaced close together. I added a new red theme, and made 
        the site seem more user friendly and modern.
