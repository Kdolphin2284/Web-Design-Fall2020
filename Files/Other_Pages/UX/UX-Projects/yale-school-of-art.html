        I took a human computer interaction class during my freshman year at Drexel University. 
        For our final project, we were tasked with redesigning a website that we felt could look better 
        than it does at the moment. Our group decided on redesigning the Yale School of Art’s website, since 
        we felt that the site wasn’t very visually pleasing which surprised us because it’s an art school’s website.

        Above is how the homepage looked, and still looks like on their website. We felt that the highlighted 
        titles were very distracting to the viewer, as well as the background animations. Yes, the entire 
        background of the homepage as well as the other pages on the website are animated. Another design choice 
        that we weren’t fans of were the colored boxes, both solid and gradient, that surround most of the 
        text and images on the website. We felt like the colors clashed with each other, that they were 
        distracting to the user, and that the content could be displayed in a much simpler, modern way than 
        they were at the moment.

        All 4 people in my group created accounts on usertesting.com so we could collect feedback from other 
        people who visited the site. We sent the link to the website, as well as various general questions about 
        the layout and user interface of the website. Each of us collected feedback from 3 users and designed the 
        website based on this feedback.

        I was specifically in charge of designing the footer of the site, as well as the navigation bar on the side.
        I chose to have the navigation bar scroll with the user so that they would not have to scroll back to the 
        top of the page to go to another section of the site. For the footer, I tried spacing out all of the options 
        as to have it feel as simple and easy to understand as possible. I also helped out with general spacing of 
        elements as well as the organization of content for the overall redesign. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Part of the assignment was to add a few interactions to the website to demonstrate how the flow of the 
        design would feel. The first interaction we added was to the search bar, which would expand when a user 
        clicked on it.

    <p>
        The second interaction we added was to the login button at the top right of the site. This interaction 
        consisted of a login menu appearing under the login button when a user clicks on it.

    <p>
        The third interaction was added to an article near the bottom of the page. We programmed the “Read More” 
        clickable option to take the user to another page, where the full article would be displayed. We also added 
        the option to either click the “Home” tab on the navigation bar or the title of the website at the top of 
        the page to go back to the homepage.

        The overall experience with working on a team to design a website was a lot of fun. We all have our 
        different design preferences and thoughts, so it was really nice to be able to come together and combine 
        ideas to create something that we are all very proud of. I’d say that this was my favorite project to work 
        on during my freshman year at Drexel University.
