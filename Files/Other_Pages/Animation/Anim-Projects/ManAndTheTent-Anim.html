            During my spring quarter as a freshman at Drexel University, I took a class called Design II in which 
            we learned about creating designs that incorporated color. For our final project we were given the task 
            of creating absolutely anything within the topic of design. I had always been intrigued by animation, but 
            I had never tried to animate anything myself. Since we were allowed to make anything we desired, I figured 
            I’d take a crack at creating an animated film.

            As a kid I was always surrounded by Disney short films, movies, shows, etc., which is where I ended up pulling 
            a lot of inspiration from for The Man and the Tent.

            As you can see, the animation is about a character who is traveling across a desert, when it suddenly turns to night.
            The character sets up a tent, but realizes that they don't know how to get into it. The rest of the film consists of the 
            character thinking of ways to get into the tent, and when all else fails, they stomp it and walk off.
